# Advent of Code 2023

I will try to solve as many days as I have the time for in as many different programming languages as I know. Execution time is only stated if I can measure it.

| Day | Language                                    | Execution time
|----:|:--------------------------------------------|:---------------
|   1 | x64 Assembly (MASM)                         | &le; 2ms (Debug mode)
|   2 | Flex + Mindustry Logic                      | ~ 12.7s (Depends on how fast you insert disk 2)

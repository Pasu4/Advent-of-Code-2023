# Day 2

## Instructions for running

1. Run `compile.sh` on a Linux (sub-)system. Flex must be installed.
2. Start [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry), load a map, place two hyper processors (A and B) and connect them to a cryofluid source.
3. Place a switch, a memory bank and a message block and connect them to both processors.
4. Paste first `input0.mlog` into processor A and then `program.mlog` into processor B.
5. Wait until the message block displays "Insert disk 2", then copy `input1.mlog` into processor A.
6. Read the input from the message block once it appears.
